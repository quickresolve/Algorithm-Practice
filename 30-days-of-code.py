# Day-0
#save input to a variable and then print it Out

inputString = raw_input() # get a line of input from stdin and save it to our variable

# Your first line of output goes here
print 'Hello, World.'

# Write the second line of output
print inputString;

#Day-1
#You must declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type string.
#Then you must read 3 lines of input from stdin and initialize your 3 variables. Finally you must use to + operator to perform the following operations:

#Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line
#Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line
#Cancatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line

# Input Format
#
# The first line contains an integer, i.
# The second line contains a double, d.
# The third line contains a string, s.

# Output Format
#
# Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.
